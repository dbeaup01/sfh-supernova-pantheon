Reproducible analysis code for Type Ia supernova time-dilation and luminosity-distance
tests within the Spacetime Flow Hypothesis (SFH).

## Overview

This repository contains a fully reproducible Jupyter / Google Colab notebook used to
compute Type Ia supernova luminosity distances and time-dilation effects within the
Spacetime Flow Hypothesis.

The analysis reproduces the results presented in the associated Zenodo preprint using
the Pantheon+ SH0ES supernova compilation, without invoking dark energy or metric
expansion.

## Contents

- **SuperNova_Luminosity_Notebook.ipynb**  
  Main reproducible analysis notebook (Google Colab compatible).

## Data

Pantheon+ SH0ES supernova data are publicly available but are **not redistributed** in
this repository.  
Users must download and place the required data locally as described in the notebook
header to respect redistribution constraints.

No proprietary or modified datasets are included.

## How to run

Click the **Open in Colab** badge above and follow the instructions provided at the top
of the notebook.

The notebook is fully self-contained once the public data files are supplied.
